# PyBer Analysis


# Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to compare sum of daily fares from January to April 2019 for PyBer, a rideshare company. For the purposes of displaying multivariate information over time, the bar chart was our weapon of choice. 

# Results
-Description of the differences in ride-sharing data among different cities including:

## Rides:
-There are many more rides occuring in more densly populated city types. See the exact figures and the calculation used below:

## Total drivers:
-The number of drivers increases in more densly populated city types. See the exact figures and the calculation used below:

## Total fares:
-The total amout of fares increases in more densly populated city types. See the exact figures and the calculation used below:

## Average fare per ride:
-The average fare per ride decreases in more densely populated city types. See the exact figures and the calculation used below:

# Summary:

## Summarize the three recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disaprities among the city types.

1. PyBer should increase the number of drivers in Urban City Types. Although the period of time measured in the analysis is limited, we observed that the most growth in daily fares exists in the Urban market.
2. PyBer should consider strategies for getting more drivers active during peaks of fare totals, and less drivers active during troughs in fare totals.
3. PyBer should conduct this same analysis over other yearly periods to test how reliable the rationale for the assumptions above are. In recommendation 1, the same analysis done over multiple years would show whether this 4 year period of growth for Urban markets is an anomoly or whether it is a pattern. In recommendation 2, the same analysis done over multiple years would give PyBer better predictive powers over fare totals, and give them a greater ability to determine reasonable numbers of drivers to have on the road during a given period of the year.
